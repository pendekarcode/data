"SEO Writing Blog Posts Tips That Rank on Google"

1. Start with keyword research.
Writing an article requires keyword research and topic thinking. Entity, long tail, related, and LSI keyword analysis are NLP methods for keyword research. Keyword research entails looking at semantically relevant terms for web spiders. Find and focus on suitable keywords with keyword research. The goal is to get blog posts on Google's top page quickly.

2. Understand Search Intent
Understanding user keyword intent is vital. Search engines are used for this reason. It explains why people use search engines. When someone looks for "best dog food," they're studying before buying. Therefore, your content must match the keyword's commercial intent.

Analysis of search intent lets you adjust content to keywords and user needs. Search engines like Google provide relevant results. Understanding search intent impacts rankings. Your pages must match keyword search intent to rank on Google.
Knowing search intent helps:
- Target keywords that meet your audience's needs to improve your content strategy.
- Understand your users' wants and create relevant content.
Show search engines that your material is useful and relevant to users to rank higher.

Types of search intent
- Navigation intent: User wants to find a specific page (for example, “Gmail login”)
- Informational intent: Users want to learn more about something (for example, “what is SEO”)
- Commercial intent: Users want to do research before making a purchasing decision (e.g., “best coffee maker”)
- Transactional intent: The user wants to complete a specific action, usually a purchase (for example, “buy a folding bike”)
Search aims and objectives may vary depending on the user's needs.

Some common search goals:
- Find information: Search for word definitions, facts, latest news, or user manuals.
- Search for answers to queries or difficulties.
- Product or service search: Search for clothing, food, airline tickets, or hotels.
- Get recommendations: Search finds product, restaurant, movie, book, and vacation recommendations.
- Search gathers data for research or analysis.

3. Explain the goal
Share your goal with the writer. Help them understand why they’re writing something and they’ll have a better chance at hitting your goal.

Examples:
Explain how to create an effective content brief.
Share our CEO’s opinion on cloud architecture.
Teach existing users how to use our new keyword clustering feature for keyword research.

4. Application of the Blog title
Google crawlers understand blog entries and sections with headings. SEO-friendly blog titles are crucial to reader engagement. An effective title is brief, straightforward, and intriguing without any symbol.

The main title blog should include target topic keywords without any symbols like ":" or "-".

Think of crawlers as readers skimming your blog. Your H1 should give them a sense of your article's topic. Then H2, H3, and H4 divide down subtopics. Heading (H2) and Subheadings(H3) should represent body content and feature high-intent keywords. Your SERP ranking increases when you use terms your target audience uses.

5. Outline Structure
An SEO-optimized outline with H1, H2, and H3 headings that reflect the main topics covered.
Structure your outline based on top-ranking articles for your target keyword. Emulate their heading structure. Use heading analyzer tools to create engaging, click-worthy headlines.

Share sub-topics to include
You can help your writer by suggesting important sub-topics to include in the article.

Common sense is a helpful guide: for an article about content briefs, you’d probably want to include a definition and a tutorial for actually creating a content brief.

You can also take a more data-driven approach to finding sub-topics.

6. Write for humans, not search engines.
With all the SEO rules, it's easy to forget that Google users want answers. Writing high-quality blog entries is the greatest strategy to rank. How does it look? Complete answers, scannable sections, organized subtitles, and very detailed.

Each paragraph is dense with an entity, semantic and related keywords. Do not place excessive keywords, this will be considered keyword spamming. Consider your reader's persona, difficulties, and interests. You should also choose topics that appeal to potential readers and solve their problems.

Each H2 heading section has at least 500 words divided into several paragraphs. Each paragraph consists of 2 to 4 sentences (make a random number in each heading/subheading section).

If you use h3, each h3 subheading comprises 2 to 4 paragraphs or 60 words. 

Both the h2 heading and h3 subheading sections must have a different number of paragraphs. But first, use 1 or 2 paragraphs in the h2 heading before we get to the h3 content. Please don't overdo it in writing h3.

Brief, precise, and brief sentences should not exceed 20 words. Reading sentences over 20 syllables is difficult. Write it SEO-friendly. Don't shorten every sentence—balance.

Suggest ways to make the article unique
Virtually every article has to compete for attention with similar articles covering the same topic. To help your article stand out, you can suggest unique information to include—things that competing articles don’t cover.

Don't utilize common transition words.
Use headings H2, subheadings H3, and structured lists to organize the article. H2 or H3 heading will be the starting point of each main section in the article. H3 subheading to break the main section into sub-sections. Use keywords in Subheadings (H2, H3, etc.) that are relevant to the content below them.

Keep keywords in headers and subheadings natural. This helps readers understand the hierarchy of information. Make sure headlines and subheadings flow logically. They must form a coherent narrative. Avoid over subheadings. Use as needed for navigation, not article clutter.

Don't overdo it in applying the unordered list format. Everything must look natural.

Take care not to abuse keywords in headers and subheadings. Do it naturally. Avoid repeating sentences (spam). Don't copy or paste articles from anywhere. Write an original article.

7. Keyword optimization.
Effective SEO boosts search engine rankings without overwhelming readers. Keyword usage must be balanced naturally.

Content should include long-tail keywords and the main keyword. It will expand your readership. For variety, use Entity and LSI keywords. It enhances substance and prevents repetition. Avoid keyword misuse. Use keywords naturally and only when appropriate to the context.

Keyword Placement
- Naturally use your main keyword and variations in the intro, conclusion, H1, H2, and image alt text. Don't over-optimize.
- Related keywords and semantic keywords should also be woven throughout the content.
- Mention your keyword 1-2 times in the first and last 100 words of post.

Remember! Keyword overuse may compromise article flow and naturalness. Avoid this SEO strategy to avoid search engine penalties.

You can use keywords without sacrificing article quality using this method. The idea is to give your audience meaningful knowledge and solutions. Search engines like Google may flag your material as irrelevant if readers struggle to grasp it.
