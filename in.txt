"SEO Writing Blog Posts Tips That Rank on Google"

1. Start with keyword research.
Keyword analysis and topic brainstorming are essential before writing an article. Keyword research uses NLP approaches, including entity, long tail keyword, related keyword, and LSI keyword analysis. Keyword research simply involves looking at phrases web crawlers consider semantically relevant. Keyword research is to find and focus on relevant keywords. The goal is for articles posted on a blog to appear on Google's top page without delay.

2. Understand Search Intent
Understanding user search intent (keyword intent) is crucial. It explains why people use search engines. It covers the reasons why someone searches for something on a search engine. For example, If someone searches for "best dog food," they're definitely researching before buying. Therefore, your material must fit the keyword's commercial intent.
By analyzing search intent, you may tailor content to keywords and user demands. Search engines like Google aim to offer relevant results. Understanding search intent affects search rankings. To rank on Google, your pages must meet the search intent behind the keywords they target.
Knowing search intent helps:
- Target keywords that meet your audience's needs to improve your content strategy.
- Understand your users' wants and create relevant content.
Show search engines that your material is useful and relevant to users to rank higher.

Types of search intent
- Navigation intent: User wants to find a specific page (for example, “Gmail login”)
- Informational intent: Users want to learn more about something (for example, “what is SEO”)
- Commercial intent: Users want to do research before making a purchasing decision (e.g., “best coffee maker”)
- Transactional intent: The user wants to complete a specific action, usually a purchase (for example, “buy a folding bike”)
Search aims and objectives may vary depending on the user's needs.

Some common search goals:
- Find information: Search for word definitions, facts, latest news, or user manuals.
- Search for answers to queries or difficulties.
- Product or service search: Search for clothing, food, airline tickets, or hotels.
- Get recommendations: Search finds product, restaurant, movie, book, and vacation recommendations.
- Search gathers data for research or analysis.

3. Application of the Blog title
Google crawlers understand blog entries and sections with headings. SEO-friendly blog titles are crucial to reader engagement. An effective title is brief, straightforward, and intriguing without any symbol.

The main title blog should include target topic keywords without any symbols like ":" or "-".

Think of crawlers as readers skimming your blog. Your H1 should give them a sense of your article's topic. Then H2, H3, and H4 divide down subtopics. Heading (H2) and Subheadings(H3) should represent body content and feature high-intent keywords. Your SERP ranking increases when you use terms your target audience uses.

4. Outline Structure
An SEO-optimized outline with H1, H2, and H3 headings that reflect the main topics covered.
Structure your outline based on top-ranking articles for your target keyword. Emulate their heading structure. Use heading analyzer tools to create engaging, click-worthy headlines. 

5. Write for humans, not search engines.
With all the SEO rules, it's easy to forget that Google users want answers. Writing high-quality blog entries is the greatest strategy to rank. How does it look? Complete answers, scannable sections, organized subtitles, and very detailed.

Each paragraph is dense with an entity, semantic and related keywords. Do not place excessive keywords, this will be considered as keyword spamming. Consider your reader's persona, difficulties, and interests. You should also choose topics that appeal to potential readers and solve their problems.

Each H2 heading section has at least 300 words divided into several paragraphs. Each paragraph consists of 2 to 4 sentences (make a random number in each heading/subheading section).

Brief, precise, and brief sentences should not exceed 20 words. Reading sentences over 20 syllables is difficult. Write it SEO-friendly. Don't shorten every sentence—balance.

Don't utilize common transition words.
Use headings H2, subheadings H3, and structured lists to organize the article. H2 or H2 heading will be the starting point of each main section in the article. H3 subheading to break the main section into sub-sections. Use keywords in Subheadings (H2, H3, etc.) that are relevant to the content below them.

Keep keywords in headers and subheadings natural. This helps readers understand the hierarchy of information. Make sure headlines and subheadings flow logically. They must form a coherent narrative. Avoid oversubheadings. Use as needed for navigation, not article clutter.

Take care not to abuse keywords in headers and subheadings. Do it naturally. Avoid repeating sentences (spam). Don't copy or paste articles from anywhere. Write an original article.

6. Keyword optimization.
Effective SEO boosts search engine rankings without overwhelming readers. Keyword usage must be balanced naturally.

Content should include long-tail keywords and the main keyword. It will expand your readership. For variety, use Entity and LSI keywords. It enhances substance and prevents repetition. Avoid keyword misuse. Use keywords naturally and only when appropriate to the context.

Keyword Placement
- Naturally use your main keyword and variations in the intro, conclusion, H1, H2, and image alt text. Don't over-optimize.
- Related keywords and semantic keywords should also be woven throughout the content.
- Mention your keyword 1-2 times in the first and last 100 words of post.

Remember! Keyword overuse may compromise article flow and naturalness. Avoid this SEO strategy to avoid search engine penalties.

You can use keywords without sacrificing article quality using this method. The idea is to give your audience meaningful knowledge and solutions. Search engines like Google may flag your material as irrelevant if readers struggle to grasp it.
